    "In projects/shelf_transport, I have worked on the script make_coastal_paths.py, which reads in a path along the active rho points that are along the coast but not including the bays, then finds points along the coast every 5km and 5km across coast from there, making boxes. See the figures below for an idea of this. The boxes are in orange. The idea is that I will look at the connectivity from and to each of the boxes and then make a matrix showing the connections. This works since it will be along-coast, whereas looking every where in map space is too hard to put in a matrix. Note that I will need to normalize by area at the end since the boxes arenâ€™t all the same size.\n",
