shelf_transport
===============

This overlaps some with the all_f simulations (first distributing drifters around the domain by grid cell, then doing uniform 5 km grid cell separation). Now simulations will be run in shelf_transport directly with 1km initial spacing.

Several notebooks reside in this project for various aspects of what I've been investigating.
